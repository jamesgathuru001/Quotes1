# Quotes

### By James Gathuru

## Description
This is a simple Angular 5 application that allows you to create quotes which allows one to add, upvote, downvote or delete a quote.

## User Requirements
The applications allows users to do the following:

+ Create a new quote.
+ Upvote or downvote a quote.
+ Delete a quote
+ See the number of upvotes and number of downvotes for each quote.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
